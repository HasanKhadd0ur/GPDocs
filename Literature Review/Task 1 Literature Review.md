### Paper 1.  Hierarchical and Incremental Structural Entropy Minimization for Unsupervised Social Event Detection
* Summary 
* Problem Formalisation

    Given a sequence of social messages $S_{streame} = m_1, ..., m_N$ as input,
    the task of social event detection can be fulfilled by constructing and partitioning a message graph $G = (V, E)$.

    The node set $V = {m_1, ..., m_N }$. 
    
    The edge set $E$ is initially empty and to be expanded by the message graph construction process. 
   
    Partitioning G results in $ \{e_1, ..., e_M\}, ei ⊂ V, ei ∩ ej = ∅$,
    which is a partition of V containing M clusters (sets) of messages that correspond to the M detected
social events.
